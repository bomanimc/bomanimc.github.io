"Reflections" contains four generalizable takeaways from my experiences during the summer of 2016. During this period of time, I was a Software Design Intern at IDEO Palo Alto. I was also working on an interactive art project called [Shrumen Lumen](/shrumen-lumen). These notes are informed by the good practices I saw modeled by my team members in each engagement. I aimed to create a more memorable, shareable write-up of my insights by documenting them in a custom layout, adorned with a colorful design and an illustration.

These are notes to myself, but other people who also work in engineering or design fields may be able to relate as well.
