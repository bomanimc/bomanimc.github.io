I created NegativeReel during a time when I was feeling gloomy. To help express my feelings, I tried sharing my negative internal dialogue in this artistic format. The vulnerability involved in sharing this work with my friends was an important step in improving my mood.

This project uses two projectors: one in the front displaying the text/GIFs, and one in the back to create the bars of light. I used a fog machine to help accentuate the light from the back projector. To cycle through the quotes, the viewer creates a fist ðŸ¤› over a Leap Motion hand sensor. The fist interaction is meant to represent the tension and release associated with vulnerability and sharing.

<br /><br />

The software is comprised of a Node server that handles all of the Leap Motion readings, and two Processing scripts that read the Leap Motion sensor values from the server. The visuals produced by the Processing scripts use a Syphon server to stream frames into MadMapper. MadMapper, a projection mapping tool, is used to warp the projection so it falls directly onto the target surface.
