To support musical artist [Jasper Lotti's 'Versions'](https://open.spotify.com/album/2oWuiYDtbQZc0It2qcw4jl) project, I created a live-mixed VJ (video jockey) set. These visuals were a backdrop for Jasper Lotti's live performances at Elsewhere, H0L0, and Playground Coffee.

Jasper gave me an initial specification on the visual direction she was aiming for: “As for aesthetics, im rlly into like optical illusion type stuff”. Using her guidance, I found an array of GIFs and clips, which were primarily sourced from Giphy. To create the performance visuals, I imported all of the clips into [CoGe Vj](https://imimot.com/cogevj/), setup visual effects and multi-clip outputs, and mapped all of the controls to an AKAI MPD32. This allowed me to control effects and combine clips in accordance with the dynamics of the performance.
