As put by my project partner Matt Zhang, “Waves is a Raspberry Pi project centered around transforming the transience of the spoken word into something concrete and physical. In our setup, a user presses a button corresponding to a question, answers it into a microphone while pressing down on the button, and then receives a receipt of the audio waveform in return. The audio waveform is also sent to a webpage, where it is displayed among the other responses that have been collected so far.”

<br /><br />

With Waves, we were excited to explore how to encode deeply personal statements in a way that would allow them to be presented in public. We imagine that the waveform prints could be carried as sentimental keepsakes.

Waves was featured on the [Raspberry Pi blog](https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/printed-sound-wave/) and  in [MagPi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/magpi-issues/MagPi61.pdf) (p.31 - p.32), the official Raspberry Pi magazine. We presented the project live at the 2017 Segal Design Expo.
