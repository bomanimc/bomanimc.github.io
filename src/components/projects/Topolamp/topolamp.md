TopoLamp is a topographic lamp I designed in summer 2016. I created the topographic layout with bezier curves in Adobe Illustrator, and made a prototype with stacked laser cut pieces of wood and acrylic. Inside, there are 24 NeoPixel LEDs controlled by an Arduino. I also added a Bluetooth module for wirelessly changing the color of the LEDs.
