Dial Up is a creative collective based in Chicago that makes music, music videos, films, and hosts a radio show. Dial Up frequently DJs across Chicago and hosted a variety of large shows and community events.

<br /><br />

One of my contributions to the collective was designing and developing our website in collaboration with a few other developers in our group. The Dial Up website was featured on [Brutalist Websites](http://brutalistwebsites.com/dialupstuff.com/). Weâ€™ve previously built a custom reading experience for the Dial Up Magazine, and a custom chat room for our radio stream.
