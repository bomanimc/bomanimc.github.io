Shrumen Lumen is [Foldhaus Collective's](https://www.foldhaus.com/shrumen-lumen/) interactive art installation made up of five glowing mushrooms that react to the presence of people. The mushrooms are made of translucent hand-folded corrugated plastic and contain up to 1600 NeoPixel LEDs. Each mushroom has an associated weight-sensing pad that – when stepped on – triggers a linear actuator to expand and contract the mushroom cap from a flat umbrella shape to a bulbous shape.

Following Burning Man 2016, Shrumen Lumen has been presented at Dubai’s Meet D3 Festival and currently on display at the [Smithsonian's Renwick Gallery](https://americanart.si.edu/exhibitions/burning-man) until January '19.
