GitRocket is a fun plugin for the Hyper terminal that launches a rocket ship when you push code with Git.

<br /><br />

After learning about Next’s [Hyper](https://hyper.is/) terminal, I was immediately excited by the customizability. Hyper is an Electron app built with React and Redux, so it’s easy to build new React components for your personalized Hyper terminal. This unlocks a world of possibilities for contextual informational displays built directly into the terminal. To begin exploring the technology, I decided to build and publish GitRocket over the course of a summer day.

GitRocket has received 38 GitHub stars and over [over 9000 downloads](https://npm-stat.com/charts.html?package=gitrocket&from=2017-07-01) via NPM. You can find GitRocket, along with other useful plugins for Hyper, on the [awesome-hyper](https://github.com/bnb/awesome-hyper) GitHub list.
