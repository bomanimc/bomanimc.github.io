When I created NegativeReel, I was feeling pretty bummed. To help express my feelings, I tried sharing my negative internal dialogue in this format. The vulnerability involved in sharing this work with my friends was an important step in improving my mood.

This project uses two projectors: one in the front displaying the text/GIFs, and one in the back to create the bars of light. I used a fog machine to help dramatize the light from the back projector. To cycle through the quotes, the viewer creates a fist ðŸ¤› over the Leap Motion hand sensor. The fist interaction is meant to represent the tension and release associated with vulnerability and sharing.

The software is comprised of a Node server that handles all of the Leap Motion readings and two Processing scripts that read the Leap Motion sensor values from the server. Those visuals produced by the Processing scripts use Syphon server to stream frame into MadMapper â€” the projection mapping software where I warp the light so it falls onto the target surfaces.
