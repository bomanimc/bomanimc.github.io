This project uses the RPM (revolutions per minute) of a bike wheel to control the intensity of effects in Ableton. To measure the RPM of the wheel, a reed switch is used in conjunction with an Arduino. The RPM value is then used to set effect values in Ableton using Max For Live.

To make projects like this more accessible to other hobbyists, I created a full tutorial video for my nascent YouTube channel focused on creative technology projects.
