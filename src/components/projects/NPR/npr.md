The News Page Index is Facebook's new product for determining which News pages should be included in the ‘Promoted News’ section of the [Political Ads Archive project](https://newsroom.fb.com/news/2018/05/ads-with-political-content/). Publishers can also submit links to policies, info, and logos in alignment with [The Trust Project's](https://thetrustproject.org/) best practices.

<br /><br />

The review processes for applications, logos, and policies are evaluated using a standard set of guidelines by human reviewers. My role in this project was building the internal review processes – including associated infrastructure and interfaces for reviewers. I worked closely with operations and reviewers to engineer systems that would optimize for correctness, efficiency, and stability.
