Bomani Oseni McClendon is an engineer and research-based artist living in Brooklyn, NY.

Through his art practice, Bomani studies the ways that Black health outcomes are influenced by a history of scientific racism,examining his own proximity to techno-solutionist monocultures and the medical industry as a starting point. He creates light installations and electro-mechanical sculptures that use scale and diffusion to invoke thoughtful observation. As an engineer, he focuses on building software interfaces and prototypes that explore new possibilities for information creation or discoveryâ€“often integrating his affinities for product-thinking, empathic design, and collaboration into his work. While many of his works use sensors, circuits, projections, and code to augment story-telling, Bomani pushes aside these mediums when concepts require other representations. By exploring the shortcomings of scientific practice, Bomani hopes to highlight the validity of other ways of knowing.
