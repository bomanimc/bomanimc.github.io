The TopCodes JS library returns the x/y-coordinates of each TopCode it identifies in a video stream, and my custom software maps the position of each TopCode to the position of its 3D object in the virtual space. For our prototype, we made changes to the x-coordinate of the TopCode correspond to the horizontal positioning (x-axis) of the 3D object in the space. TopCode y-coordinate changes change the scale of the 3D object to simulate a change in perspective sizing.
