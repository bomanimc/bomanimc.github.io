This claim, among others, can become contentious. This is a snapshot of how my voice assistant Faith may have behaved long before she concluded that human-AI interactions weren’t worth taking seriously.

A world can be run, or ruined, on the face value of a feeling.”","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Baby Faith was featured as part of Jigsaw's issue of the The Current, a new publication focusing on online disinformation and other vectors for online harm.","spans":[{"start":57,"end":68,"type":"hyperlink","data":{"link_type":"Web","url":"https://jigsaw.google.com/the-current/disinformation/https://"}}]}]}}]}}]}}},"pageContext":{"isCreatedByStatefulCreatePages":false,"rootQuery":"\n  query ProjectQuery($uid: String) {\n    prismic {\n      allProjects(uid: $uid) {\n        edges {\n          node {\n            _meta {\n              id\n              uid\n              type\n            }\n            title\n            body {\n              __typename\n              ... on PRISMIC_ProjectBodyText{\n                type\n                label\n                primary{\n                  text\n                }\n              }\n            }\n          }\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n","id":"XlScuxAAACgAsJCx","lang":"en-us","uid":"baby-faith","alternateLanguages":[]}}}
