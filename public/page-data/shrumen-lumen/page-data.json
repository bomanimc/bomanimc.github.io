The mushrooms are made of translucent hand-folded corrugated plastic and contain up to 1600 NeoPixel LEDs. Each mushroom has an associated weight-sensing pad that – when stepped on – triggers a linear actuator to expand and contract the mushroom cap from a flat umbrella shape to a bulbous shape.","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"The initial version of the software was built with Node and C running on a Raspberry Pi, which I spoke about in more detail in my !!Con 2017 talk 'Making Mushrooms Glow'. In late 2017, we refactored the implementation of the project. The LEDs are now driven with a PixLite ArtNET controller and MadMapper sketches exported to a MiniMad. I rewrote the code so that we could use Arduino to control the weight-sensing pad, pad LED interactions, and linear actuator. This setup has proved to be more reliable than our Raspberry Pi setup for long-term installments.","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"Shrumen Lumen was initially built to display at Burning Man '16.
