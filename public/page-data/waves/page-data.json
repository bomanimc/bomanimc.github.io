In our setup, a user presses a button corresponding to a question, answers it into a microphone while pressing down on the button, and then receives a receipt of the audio waveform in return. The audio waveform is also sent to a webpage, where it is displayed among the other responses that have been collected so far.”","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"","spans":[]},{"type":"paragraph","text":"With Waves, we were excited to explore how to encode deeply personal statements in a way that would allow them to be presented in public.
