This app includes additional resources about predictive policing and, specifically, allows people with the app to stay up-to-date on news articles about predictive policing curated by American Artist. The title of the app is a reference to Philip K. Dick's 1956 science fiction novel \"Minority Report\". Set in the year 2054, the novel foretold the use of predictive policing as well as the faultiness of it's predictions.
